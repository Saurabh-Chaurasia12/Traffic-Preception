![cover_image_raw](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cf37c66-a437-454d-99e0-cbad25f3fb4c)

## 🔍 Overview
With growing urban traffic congestion, real-time monitoring is crucial for improving road safety and traffic flow. This project leverages deep learning models, specifically YOLOv8, to detect and track multiple traffic elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and lanes. It provides real-time insights to assist city planners, law enforcement, and autonomous vehicle applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **YOLOv8 Model Implementation:** Utilize a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect traffic objects with high accuracy.
- **Dataset Preparation:** Use an annotated dataset to improve detection capabilities for various objects.
- **Fine-Tuning the Model:** Apply transfer learning to refine the YOLOv8 model for real-world traffic scenarios.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assess model accuracy with learning curves, confusion matrices, and metric analysis.
- **Real-Time Inference:** Implement live video processing to track and analyze traffic conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Export the trained model in ONNX format for seamless deployment.

## 📚 Dataset Description
### 🌐 Overview
This project uses a diverse traffic dataset that includes annotated images and videos of road environments, vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.

### 🔍 Specifications 
- 🚗 **Classes**: Vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic signs, lanes, etc.
- 🖼️ **Total Images/Videos**: High-quality annotated data for training and validation.
- 📏 **Image Resolution**: 1280 × 720 pixels
- 📂 **Format**: YOLOv8 annotation format

### 🔄 Pre-processing
To preprocess video datasets and convert them into image frames with a defined interval:
sh
python preprocess.py --video /path/to/video --output /path/to/output


### 🔢 Dataset Split
- **Training Set**: Majority of data for model training.
- **Validation Set**: Used for unbiased model evaluation.
- **Test Set**: Separate test data to assess final model performance.
